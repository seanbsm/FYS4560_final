Current plan:
-An introduction where; I explain why extra dimensions (ED) is an 
 attractive theory (makes it possible to measure graviton AND fits with 
 current models), which ED models will be considered in this report, a 
 short (a few lines) history of ED models.

-Start by briefly discussing the various models for extra dimensions: 
 large extra dim, warped extra dim, and universal extra dim

-In order to explain RS and ADD, I will need a chapter on Kaluza-Klein
 (KK) theory. Mostly to explain KK towers and their connection to the 
 graviton. Perhaps, in addition, explain why the graviton must have
 spin-2.

-A chapter on RS and one on ADD, both in which I try to explain how the
 theories "look" at the graviton, besides explaining the theories and
 their assumptions.

-After the theory-part, I want to get an idea of the uniqueness of
 graviton measurements (different CS, FB asymmetry, ...) by calculating
 the simplest proton-proton graviton production; qqbar -> G -> l+l-. 
 This would be nice since we've done this for the Higgs boson, and can 
 therefore compare plots.

-I would like to make use of CompHep, but I'm unsure exactly what I
 achieve in the given timespan. I haven't included anything in the
 abstract of this, since I want the simulation to fit nicely with the
 theory, but I don't know enough yet to say anything about it.

-Discuss current search program for the graviton at the LHC, possibly 
 future plans.

-A conclusion.



Current abstract:
 -Two of the most promising theories for extra dimensions, the 
  Randall-Sundrum (RS) and Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali (ADD) models,
  will be reviewed and their connection to the hypothesized graviton
  boson will be studied. Quark-anti-quark annihilation into dilepton 
  final state by the simplest possible massive graviton propagator (
  1st order tower of Kaluza-Klein excitations) will be calculated.
  Lastly, the current extra dimension search program at the LHC will be 
  discussed.
